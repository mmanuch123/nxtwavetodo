# Todo List Manager

A simple and responsive Todo List application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by adding, editing, deleting, marking as complete, and filtering them. The tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring data persistence across sessions.

## Features

- **Add Task:** Easily add new tasks with a title, priority (High, Medium, Low), and deadline.
- **Display Tasks:** View all your tasks in a clear list, showing the title, priority (color-coded), deadline, and completion status.
- **Mark as Completed:** Toggle the completion status of tasks with a simple checkbox. Completed tasks are visually distinguished.
- **Edit Task:** Modify the title, priority, or deadline of existing tasks.
- **Delete Task:** Remove unwanted tasks from your list.
- **Local Storage:** Your tasks are saved in your browser's local storage, so they persist even after you close the page.
- **Filter Tasks:** Filter tasks by their status (All, Pending, Completed) and priority (All, High, Medium, Low).
- **Responsive Design:** The application layout adapts to different screen sizes, providing a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Visual Indicators:**
    - **Priority:** Tasks are tagged with colors indicating their priority (High: Red, Medium: Purple, Low: Teal).
    - **Overdue:** Tasks with a deadline that has passed are marked as "Overdue" in red.
    - **Due Soon:** Tasks nearing their deadline will indicate the time left (e.g., "Due tomorrow", "Due in 5 days").
